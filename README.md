# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

This project creates a binary classifier neural network machine learning model that will analyze a dataset containing 34,000 entries of organizations which have been funded by a company called Alphabet Soup to predict whether a new organization will be successful upon receiving charity from Alphabet Soup in the future.

### Purpose

Predicting whether an organization can be benefitted by Alphabet Soup's charity will help Alphabet Soup decide who to give money to and who to avoid giving charity to, which will enable them to spend their resources in a smarter way.
